### Why is behavioral data science important for psychology and cognitive science?

Chris:

The study of behavior is implicitly linked to psychology and cognitive science.
Until someone invents a mind-reading machine (or successfully trains a neural 
network on MRI or EEG results), behavior is the clearest window through which 
we can examine the inner workings of the mind. All that's left, then, is to 
explain where data science fits into this puzzle.

Let's first establish that studying behavior is hard. People (or really, any 
agents that exhibit cognition) are complicated and tricky scientific subjects. Often, 
other fields of study provide the means to make definitive, atomic statements 
from which to build more complex theories. Chemical experiments can isolate variables 
and produce easily measurable results. Mathematics provides a framework for 
rigorous proof. Even a field as complex as climate science is built on physics; 
the chaotic nature of climate systems makes predictive models incredibly difficult 
to build, but the underlying functional principles are fairly well understood. 

Cognitive agents provide no such methods for clean, easily understood results. 
When people are the subject of study, they bring their biases. Not only is every 
person unique, but even given the same person, an experiment might find different 
behavioral results depending on how much sleep or food that person has had recently, 
or what's going on in their life, or any number of other factors. The mind is too 
complicated to estimate with good models built on principle, and too noisy to 
make poignant and useful insights based on data---without some extra tools in our belt.

This is where data science comes in. Data science provides us with a wide-ranging 
set of techniques we can use to extract meaningful results from the kind of dirty, noisy 
data we get when we study cognitive agents. In other words, when we're thinking about 
psychology and cognitive science, behavioral data science is the toolbox we use 
to make interesting and insightful statements *despite* the difficulties presented 
by the noisy data and complicated systems implicit in studying cognition. Through
effective data science practices such as incorporating strong theory-building and strong 
models, this would be achieved.

Data science can also provide insights to good experimental design. When performing 
experiments, it is essential to mitigate as many confounding variables as
possible. In the context of psychology, human participants are never identical 
(unless we count genetics for identical twins), which leads to uncontrolled variance. 
In order to study human behavior, it is essential to isolate these variables so that
the only significant dependent variables are the desired behaviors. Through the 
development of experiments with the incorporation of these components, they can be 
reproduced allowing for the results to be strengthened. In doing so, they allow for
more intellectual growth and stability in the field.
